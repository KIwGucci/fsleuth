* This repository is under development.

## This is a command line tool that performs file searches in the terminal.
Immediately after launching, enter the file extension you wish to search for.

#### Then use the following commands.

* "@quit" or "@q" 
    => Exit.

* "@ext" or "@e" or "@ex" 
    => Enter the file extension to search for. The * will be a wildcard.

* "@open" or "@o" or "@op" 
=> Enter mode to display search results in the file manager.

* Any word 
=> Search results for files with matching names will be displayed.
    Multiple refinements are performed, separated by spaces. However, the first word must be in the file name. Subsequent words are also used for path searching.
